          Optimize your sourcing
        %p
          Never waste your time in an interview again. MetaBright's <strong>Evaluator</strong> measures and verfies the skills of your job candidates <span style="font-family: 'MuliItalic';">before</span> you interview them. 
          Just direct your candidates to your unique MetaBright URL, and we take care of the rest. 
        %h3
          Our philosophy
        %p
          When evaluating a potential new-hire, we believe the most important thing is whether that person has the skills necessary to do the job. Things like where they went to school or where they previously worked are just distractions from what really matters: Can they perform?
        %h3 
          How it works
        %ol
          %li Choose the skills where you want your candidates measured.
          %li We'll give you a unique MetaBright URL.
          %li Include your this URL with your job posting. 
          %li MetaBright evaluates the skills of each candidate, and you decide who to interview. 
        %h3 FAQ
        #faq_accordion.accordion          
          .accordion-group
            .accordion-heading
              %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseTwo"}
                How are my candidates evaluated?
            #collapseTwo.accordion-body.collapse.in
              .accordion-inner
                We evaluate your candidates with things called <strong>Challenges</strong> -- fancy quizzes that analyze people's raw knowledge, their creative ability, and what they’ve accomplished. 
                We distill all this information down into one easy to understand percentile ranking that indicates how capable your candidates actually are.
          .accordion-group
            .accordion-heading
              %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseThree"}
                How many Challenges do I need?
            #collapseThree.accordion-body.collapse
              .accordion-inner
                Anticipate which skills you want your candidates evaluated on. Multiply this count by the number of candidates you expect to measure. 
                (It’s typically best to get more Challenges than you think you’ll need because your unused Challenges will roll over from the previous month.)
          .accordion-group
            .accordion-heading
              %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseFour"}
                How long will it take for my candidates to complete a Challenge?
            #collapseFour.accordion-body.collapse
              .accordion-inner
                Each Challenge can be completed in less than 10 minutes.
          .accordion-group
            .accordion-heading
              %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseFive"}
                How does MetaBright work to prevent cheating?
            #collapseFive.accordion-body.collapse
              .accordion-inner
                MetaBright questions are timed so we have a good understanding of who actually knows the material and who is trying to cheat (or who is getting lucky with a guess!). 
                Our algorithms look for irregularities when a candidate is taking a Challenge and adjust their percentile accordingly.
          .accordion-group
            .accordion-heading
              %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseSix"}
                Why does MetaBright look so playful?
            #collapseSix.accordion-body.collapse
              .accordion-inner
                We’ve found that people are more likely to stay engaged with a Challenge when incentives are in place to make the process feel like a game. 
                This means we can evaluate your candidates with a higher degree of confidence and we can deliver more examples of their abilities!
