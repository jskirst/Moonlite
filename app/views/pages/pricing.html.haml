              #collapseSix.accordion-body.collapse.in
                .accordion-inner 
                  Having multiple admins for your account allows you to easily share information and manage candidates across your organization. You'll want to have an administrator seat for every person in your organization who is involved in the talent acquisition process.

                %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseThree"} 
                  Do I have to sign up for a contract or pre-pay for my Evaluator subscription? 
              #collapseThree.accordion-body.collapse
                .accordion-inner 
                  Nope! Evaluator subscriptions are month-to-month. There are no contracts or obligations to continue your membership any longer than you want. You'll be billed monthly and can cancel anytime.
            .accordion-group 
              .accordion-heading 
                %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseOne"} 
                  How are my candidates evaluated? 
              #collapseOne.accordion-body.collapse
                .accordion-inner 
                  We evaluate your candidates with things called <strong>Challenges</strong> -- fancy quizzes that analyze people's raw knowledge, their creative ability, and what they’ve accomplished. 
                  We distill all this information down into one easy to understand score that indicates how capable a candidate actually is. 
            .accordion-group 
              .accordion-heading 
                %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseTwo"} 
                  How long will it take for my candidates to complete a Challenge? 
              #collapseTwo.accordion-body.collapse 
                .accordion-inner 
                  It depends on the Challenge, and the skill of the candidate, but most Challenges can be completed in under 20 minutes.
            .accordion-group 
              .accordion-heading 
                %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseFour"} 
                  How does MetaBright work to prevent cheating? 
              #collapseFour.accordion-body.collapse 
                .accordion-inner 
                  MetaBright questions are timed so we have a good understanding of who actually knows the material and who is trying to cheat (or who is getting lucky with a guess!).  
                  Our algorithms look for irregularities when a candidate is taking a Challenge and adjust their percentile accordingly. 
                  We also work to ensure that your candidate is actually the one taking the Challenge. 
            .accordion-group 
              .accordion-heading 
                %a.accordion-toggle{"data-parent" => "#faq_accordion", "data-toggle" => "collapse", "data-parent" => "true", :href => "#collapseFive"} 
                  Why does MetaBright look so playful? 
              #collapseFive.accordion-body.collapse 
                .accordion-inner 
                  We’ve found that people are more likely to stay engaged with a Challenge when incentives are in place to make the process feel like a game.  
                  This means we can evaluate your candidates with a higher degree of confidence and we can deliver more examples of their abilities!
