	<h2>It's Alive!</h2>
	<p>We've just pushed the latest build of Project Moonlite live to production on heroku as of last night. You can find the site, for the time being, at:</p>
	<p>http://projectmoonlite.heroku.com</p>
	<p>We'll be moving upstairs to www.projectmoonlite.com once we reach a solid alpha stage, but a little more obscurity from the Google is preferable right now until we put our face on. Once we open the site up to limited registration we'll be updating this space regularly as we add features.</p>
