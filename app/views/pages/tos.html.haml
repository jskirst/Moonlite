        %h4 The Rules
        %p 
          We built MetaBright for people like us. People who like to get better at life every single day, and think it's easier to do so with the right people around.
          If you infringe upon our users ability to do this, we will unleash the wrath of Hades upon you.
          Or we'll ban you - depends on the mood we're in that day.
        %p
          The rules are, quite simply, don't be a jerk - treat others the way you want to be treated.
          And if you like to be abused, then MetaBright isn't the place for you, but we can suggest some specialty clubs in San Francisco that might be up your alley.
        %ul
          %li No hate speech
          %li No harassment or threats of violence against others
