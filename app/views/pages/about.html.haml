        %h4 Our Philosophy
        %p
          At MetaBright, we believe in the transparency of knowledge.
        %p
          In a nutshell, this means you deserve to know what you know, and you deserve to know what other people know.
          We think this allows for more meaningful connections, faster growth, and can make your passions way more fun.
        %p
          Think about it: would you rather travel down a path all by yourself, uncertain of who you're taking advice from and the kind of progress you're making, or would you rather have proof of what you know, and have access to guidance from the most reputable people?
