        Congratulations! You've just made a great decision to start sourcing and validating your candidates in a quicker and more streamlined way. Take a look at the nav bar at the top of the page. Here's a quick look at what everything does:
        %ul 
          %li Evaluations: This is where you create and manage all your Evaluations. Your candidates' results are organized here as well.
          %li Challenges: If you want to test your candidates on custom content specific to your company, you'll want to start here. After you create a Challenge, you can access it in any Evaluation you set up.
          %li Account: Details of your company plan and settings are located here. You can invite additional people to your account, change your plan, and even add custom CSS styles to your Evaluations.
