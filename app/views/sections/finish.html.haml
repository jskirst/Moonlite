            %span What's a MetaScore?
            %br
            Your MetaScore is like a credit score for a particular skill.
            Similar to a credit score, it ranges from 300 to 850.
            Your MetaScore is based on how well you perform in all areas of a Challenge. 
            It takes into account many variables such as question difficulty, response time, and breadth of questions taken.
          %p
            %span How does my MetaScore differ from my point total?
            %br
            It differs in a couple different ways:
            %ul
              %li Your MetaScore can fluctuate up and down, whereas your point total can only go up. 
              %li Your point total and level could be visible on the Challenge homepage. Your MetaScore is only visible on your profile.
              %li The accuracy of your MetaScore improves over time to approximate your actual ability in a Challenge. Your point total could be independent of actual ability.        
          %p
            %span How is my percentile calculated?
            %br
            Your percentile is based on how your MetaScore compares with other people who have taken the same Challenge.    
          %p 
            %span But I've barely done anything yet!
            %br
            If you're just starting out, your MetaScore ranking may not be that accurate yet. 
            The more you do in a Challenge, the truer your percentile ranking should be.
          %p
            %span Who can see my MetaScore and percentile?
            %br
            Your MetaScore is visible on your profile, although you can choose to make it private at any time. 
            If you choose to use MetaBright to surface jobs or internships for you, your MetaScore and percentile will be anonymously visible to potential employers (ie. your name or other identifying information won't be used).
          %p
            %span How can I improve my MetaScore and percentile?
            %br          
            If you think your scores aren't indicative of your abilities, you likely just haven't taken enough questions yet. 
            If your percentile has flat-lined, then it's best to spend some time getting better at the Challenge topic and then come back to MetaBright later to re-evaluate your skills.
