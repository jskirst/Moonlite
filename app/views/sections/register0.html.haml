            How does it work?
          %ul
            %li Employers can view people's <strong>anonymized</strong> score and answers. 
            %li If an employer thinks you're a good fit, we'll send you details about the position they have open.
            %li You get to decide whether or not you want to talk to the employer. You're under no obligation whatsoever.
          %h4
            Will I get spammed?
          %p 
            Absolutely not. Your contact information is only released if you want to connect with the employer.
          %h4 
            Can I change my mind?
          %p
            Yes. It's as simple as changing a setting on your profile.
          %h4 
            But I already have a job...
          %p 
            You never know if a better job is just around the corner. MetaBright will constantly work in the background to keep an eye out for you. But you're status is totally private - you're boss will never know!
