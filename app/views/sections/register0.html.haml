            How does it work?
          %ul
            %li Employers can view people's <strong>anonymized</strong> score and answers. 
            %li If an employer thinks you're a good fit, we'll send you details about the position.
            %li You get to decide whether or not you want to talk to the employer. You're under no obligation whatsoever.          
          %h4 
            But I already have a job...
          %p 
            You never know if a better job is just around the corner. MetaBright will keep an eye out for you. Best of all, your status is totally private - your boss will never know!
          %h4
            Can I improve my score?
          %p
            You bet. There are a bunch of ways to earn points, and you can retake questions you might have missed.
          %h4
            Will I get spammed?
          %p 
            Absolutely not. Your contact information is only revealed if you choose to connect with the employer.
          %h4 
            Can I change my mind?
          %p
            Yes. It's as simple as changing a setting on your profile.
