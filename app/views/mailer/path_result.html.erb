<p>Hello <%= @user.name %>,</p>
<p>Unfortunately you did not get a high enough score to pass the <%= @path.name %> <%= @name_for_paths %>. You got <%= @enrollment.percentage_correct %>% correct, and you need to get <%= @path.passing_score %>% or better. Don't worry, you can try again, but first you'll need to complete another report to get more practice. Once you do so, please email support@infoarmy.com to take the certification test again.</p>
<% end %>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>-The <%= @current_company.name %> Team</p>
