Oracle does not recommend using the DBMS_RANDOM package to generate random keys for data encryption. Why not?,,,The DBMS_RANDOM package generates pseudo-random numbers.

Data warehouse provides read-only access for all users except for data load. To prevent unathorized changes in the data, the load and/or data updates (with write privilege) are stored first in staging area, thus giving the administrator full control over who can load/update the data in the warehouse.",http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/server.121/e17749/concept.htm#DWHSG8070,Data Warehouse Architectures,Data Warehousing,Medium
"When designing a Data warehouse schema, it is highly recommended that you use a normalized schema. Which normal form (NF) is recommended?",,,3NF,2NF,4NF,5NF,http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/server.121/e17749/ch2logdes.htm#DWHSG9227,Data Warehousing Logical Design,Data Warehousing,Expert
"A typical data warehouse logical schema contains Dimension tables, Hierarchy tables and Fact tables. What is stored in the Fact tables?",,,"Fact tables describe the business transactions of an enterprise and include facts (also called measures) such as sales, units, and inventory. There are usualy few but large tables that are updated periodically with data.","Fact tables describe the business entities of an enterprise, represented as hierarchical, categorical information such as time, departments, locations, and products. Fact tables are sometimes called lookup or reference tables.","Fact tables describe the business relationships and common access patterns in the database. An analysis of the facts, combined with an understanding of the typical work load, can be used to create materialized views.",Fact tables contain a summary of the data and pre-calculated aggregates on typical data that are used to speed up typical queries.These are created for data that is fairly static so that the precalculated values remain relevant for reasonably long periods.,http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/server.121/e17749/basicmv.htm#DWHSG8169,Data Warehousing Terminology,Data Warehousing,Expert
"The process of extracting data from source systems and bringing it into the data warehouse is commonly called ETL, which stands for extraction, transformation, and loading. It also includes data transportation, which is often integrated with other parts of ETL. Which of the following is NOT used as a transportation mechanism in data warehouses?",,,Transportation using a cloud based staging area.,Transportation using flat files.,Transportation through distributed queries.,Transportation using transportable tablespaces.,http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/server.121/e17749/transport.htm#DWHSG8299,Transportation Mechanisms in Data Warehouses,Data Warehousing,Easy
Spatial and Graph uses a two-tier query model to resolve spatial queries and spatial joins. The term is used to indicate that two distinct operations (primary and secondary) are performed to resolve queries. What is the purpose of these operations?,,,"The primary filter applies computationally low-cost criteria to approximate the result. Secondary filter applies exact, high-cost criteria to produce the accurate end result.",The primary filter computes results in the direction of the x-axis (a subset of data in the x-axis direction). The secondary filter computes results in the direction of the y-axis. The intersection of the two result sets gives the required accurate result.,The Oracle Spatial uses a version of distributed computing for spatial queries. The primary filter is the distributed query that computes result over a slice (a subset) of data. The secondary filter merges the primary results into the single result.,"Geographical data may yield a different result depending on the vector of computation. To ensure accurate results, Oracle Spatial performs 2 queries using different directional vectors, the primary query result is adjusted by the secondary query to produce the accurate end result.",http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/appdev.121/e17896/sdo_intro.htm#SPATL453,Query Model,Spatial and Graph,Medium
"A spatial index, like any other index, provides a mechanism to limit searches, but in this case the mechanism is based on spatial criteria such as intersection and containment. Oracle Spatial and Graph uses 'R-Tree index'. How does the 'R-Tree index' index data?",,,An R-tree index approximates each geometry shape by a single rectangle that minimally encloses the geometry shape (a minimum bounding rectangle).,An R-Tree index (similarly to a B-Tree index) indexes the spatial coordinate points that define each geometry shape.,An R-Tree index approximates each geometry shape by typically 4 (or N+1 where N is a number of spatial dimensions) points located at the geometry shape edge,"An R-Tree index is a composite index of N (N is a number of spatial dimensions) B-Tree indexes, each indexing coordinates alongside the  corresponding axis (dimension).",http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/appdev.121/e17896/sdo_intro.htm#SPATL455,Indexing of Spatial Data,Spatial and Graph,Expert

"To perform a spatial query, you can use the SDO_FILTER(arg1,arg2) operator. What is the function of the operator?

"In matching addresses, the match mode for a geocoding operation determines how closely the attributes of an input address must match the data being used for the geocoding. The default matching mode is RELAX_POSTAL_CODE. What does this mean for address matching?",,,"The postal code (if provided), street base name, building number, and street type can be different from the data used for geocoding.","The postal code (if provided) may differ, given that the base name, building number exactly matches the data used for geocoding.","If the postal code matches, then the street base name, building number, and street type can be different from the data used for geocoding.",The addresses without provided postal codes will not be matched.,http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E16655_01/appdev.121/e17896/sdo_geocode_concepts.htm#SPATL045,Concepts for Geocoding,Spatial and Graph,Hard
